# STEPS for setup

* To run the application clone it to your pc and cd to CRUD-Go-MariaDB
* Then write the command "go run ."
* Now you can test the application using Postman or
* Install the REST Client extension to your vscode and the open up any file in API-test and press Send Request Button

```
Before that you should also set up your database inside db/db.go 

(In my case I am running the image of mariaDB inside the Docker container and then took the usename and password set there.) 

If you want you can use mySQL database as well- for that you should just import that package and insert you db url.
